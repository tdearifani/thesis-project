Containing the final task (thesis) I did with the topic of this project is a smoker tongue detection system with deep learning algorithms using Matlab. The title is Implementation of Deep Learning Modelling on Smoker's Tongue Image Detection System VNIR-Based.

This project is the first project I've done together with my supervisor in drafting each code. This project is about image processing to detect a person is a smoker or not from his or her tongue. 

The inputs used are raw data and HDR data from hyperspectral cameras, where the camera is Visible Near-Infrared based, which has wavelengths between 400 - 1000 nm.  Data processing includes image correction, image segmentation, dataset formation, classification model formation, and classification process. The resulting output of this image processing is in the form of two classes, namely smokers or non-smokers.

The formation of classification models used the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm and compared it to the Support Vector Machine (SVM).

The camera used is SPECIM FX10 and a halogen lamp as a light source.
